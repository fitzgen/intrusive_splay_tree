//! An intrusive, allocation-free [splay tree] implementation.
//!
//! [![](https://docs.rs/intrusive_splay_tree/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/intrusive_splay_tree/)

//! [![Travis CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fitzgen/intrusive_splay_tree.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fitzgen/intrusive_splay_tree)
//!
//! Splay trees are self-adjusting, meaning that operating on an element (for
//! example, doing a `find` or an `insert`) rebalances the tree in such a way
//! that the element becomes the root. This means that subsequent operations on
//! that element are *O(1)* as long as no other element is operated on in the
//! meantime.
//!
//! ## Implementation and Goals
//!
//! * **Intrusive:** The space for the subtree pointers is stored *inside* the
//! element type. In non-intrusive trees, we would have a node type that
//! contains the subtree pointers and either a pointer to the element or we
//! would move the element into the node. The intrusive design inverts the
//! relationship, so that the elements hold the subtree pointers within
//! themselves.
//!
//! * **Freedom from allocations and moves:** The intrusive design enables this
//! implementation to fully avoid both allocations and moving elements in
//! memory. Since the space for subtree pointers already exists in the element,
//! no allocation is necessary, just a handful of pointer writes. Therefore,
//! this implementation can be used in constrained environments that don't have
//! access to an allocator (e.g. some embedded devices or within a signal
//! handler) and with types that can't move in memory (e.g. `pthread_mutex_t`).
//!
//! * **Small code size:** This implementation is geared towards small code
//! size, and uses trait objects internally to avoid the code bloat induced by
//! monomorphization. This implementation is suitable for targeting WebAssembly,
//! where code is downloaded over the network, and code bloat delays Web page
//! loading.
//!
//! * **Nodes do not have parent pointers**: An intrusive node is only two words
//! in size: left and right sub tree pointers. There are no parent pointers,
//! which would require another word of overhead. To meet this goal, the
//! implementation uses the "top-down" variant of splay trees.
//!
//! [splay tree]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_tree
//! [paper]: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sleator/papers/self-adjusting.pdf
//!
//! ## Constraints
//!
//! * **Elements within a tree must all have the same lifetime.** This means
//! that you must use something like the [`bumpalo`][arena] crate for
//! allocation, or be working with static data, etc.
//!
//! * **Elements in an intrusive collections are inherently shared.** They are
//! always potentially aliased by the collection(s) they are in. In the other
//! direction, a particular intrusive collection only has a shared reference to
//! the element, since elements can both be in many intrusive collections at the
//! same time. Therefore, you cannot get a unique, mutable reference to an
//! element out of an intrusive splay tree. To work around this, you may need to
//! liberally use interior mutability, for example by leveraging `Cell`,
//! `RefCell`, and `Mutex`.
//!

//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! This example defines a `Monster` type, where each of its instances live
//! within two intrusive trees: one ordering monsters by their name, and the
//! other ordering them by their health.
//!
//! ```
//! use intrusive_splay_tree::{impl_intrusive_node, SplayTree};
//!
//! use std::cmp::Ordering;
//! use std::marker::PhantomData;
//!
//! // We have a monster type, and we want to query monsters by both name and
//! // health.
//! #[derive(Debug)]
//! struct Monster<'a> {
//!     name: String,
//!     health: u64,
//!
//!     // An intrusive node so we can put monsters in a tree to query by name.
//!     by_name_node: intrusive_splay_tree::Node<'a>,
//!
//!     // Another intrusive node so we can put monsters in a second tree (at
//!     // the same time!) and query them by health.
//!     by_health_node: intrusive_splay_tree::Node<'a>,
//! }
//!
//! // Define a type for trees where monsters are ordered by name.
//! struct MonstersByName;
//!
//! // Implement `IntrusiveNode` for the `MonstersByName` tree, where the
//! // element type is `Monster` and the field in `Monster` that has this tree's
//! // intrusive node is `by_name`.
//! impl_intrusive_node! {
//!     impl<'a> IntrusiveNode<'a> for MonstersByName
//!     where
//!         type Elem = Monster<'a>,
//!         node = by_name_node;
//! }
//!
//! // Define how to order `Monster`s within the `MonstersByName` tree by
//! // implementing `TreeOrd`.
//! impl<'a> intrusive_splay_tree::TreeOrd<'a, MonstersByName> for Monster<'a> {
//!     fn tree_cmp(&self, rhs: &Monster<'a>) -> Ordering {
//!         self.name.cmp(&rhs.name)
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // And do all the same things for trees where monsters are ordered by health...
//! struct MonstersByHealth;
//! impl_intrusive_node! {
//!     impl<'a> IntrusiveNode<'a> for MonstersByHealth
//!     where
//!         type Elem = Monster<'a>,

//!         self.health.cmp(&rhs.health)
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // We can also implement `TreeOrd` for other types, so that we can query the

//! // tree by some `u64` health value, and we want to query the `MonstersByName`
//! // tree by some `&str` name value.
//!
//! impl<'a> intrusive_splay_tree::TreeOrd<'a, MonstersByHealth> for u64 {
